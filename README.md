# Battery Passport Ontology

The Battery Passport Ontology is intended to provide a basis for the Battery Passport proposed by the European Union. The ontology aims to model sustainability indicators across the battery value chain to enable improvements by using analyzing methods such as Life Cycle Assessment. The Battery Pass Ontology does not claim to be complete. Rather, it is a concept that will be continuously developed.

## Framework

The presented framework shows the structure and interfaces in which the Battery Passport Ontology is embedded. The goal is to develop a centralized knowledge base addressing sustainability aspects for batteries. The Battery Passport Ontology is designed to serve as the backbone of an open-source platform that can be accessed by various stakeholders. The publicly available knowledge should help to promote interoperability and develop more sustainable, energy dense, and affordable batteries.

## Structure

The basic structure of the Battery Passport Ontology represents how the battery itself is connected to the value chain and the sustainability indicators. The battery value chain has an impact on the ecological, economic, and social indicators that correspond to the three pillars of sustainability. With appropriate references and stakeholder information, an impact assessment can be performed.

## References

The Battery Passport Ontology is based on the Battery Value Chain Ontology (BVCO). The Battery Passport Ontology uses the technical description of the battery and its components as well as the representation of the battery value chain.
